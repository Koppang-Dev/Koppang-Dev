### 🔧 **Currently Working On**
- **[TrailBlazer 🌟 ](https://github.com/Koppang-Dev/TrailBlazeWebApp)**: A dynamic trip planner built with **Next.js** and **React** for the frontend, and **Express.js** for the backend. This innovative application leverages a **Language Model (LLM)** to provide personalized travel recommendations, making trip planning effortless. Currently, I’m focused on implementing user authentication using **Firebase** while ensuring seamless integration with **MongoDB** for efficient data management. With TrailBlazer, users can receive tailored suggestions for destinations, activities, and itineraries, making their travel planning experience more enjoyable and efficient.

- **[NBA Stats Plus App 🏀](https://github.com/Koppang-Dev/NBAStatsPlus)**:A comprehensive application that provides NBA information and entertainment, featuring user authentication through Google Firebase for easy login and signup with email and username. Users can view upcoming game schedules and real-time scores by utilizing the balldontlie.io API for dynamic updates. The app also displays conference and league standings, with data scraped from FoxSports and stored in a MySQL database, presented using PHP. Additionally, users can enjoy curated NBA videos gathered from Instagram, powered by a Python script and AVFoundation for seamless playback. Built using Swift for the iOS interface, along with Python, HTML, SQL, and PHP for backend functionalities, the NBA Stats Plus App follows the MVVM architecture pattern to ensure a clean separation of concerns. Watch a demonstration of the app's features in action on my YouTube channel (link to be added).

- **[ToS-Flagger-Extension 🚀](https://github.com/Koppang-Dev/ToS-Flagger-Extension)**: A Chrome extension designed to summarize and identify red flags in companies' Terms of Service (ToS). This extension aims to simplify the often complex and lengthy ToS documents, providing users with clear summaries and highlighting potential concerns. Currently focusing on enhancing the summarization algorithm and improving the user interface for a better user experience.
